export const SOURCE_FORENSICS_PROMPT = `Analyze the complete reference video for reconstruction evidence. Return structured observations with normalized and original timestamps, confidence, and direct-observation versus inference labels.

Required timeline analysis:
- Report the exact delivered duration, shot count, every cut or gradual transition, and an ordered segment list. Each segment must include startMs, endMs, durationMs, source-shot identity, and transition-in type.
- Classify the video's overall playback as real_time, sped_up, slowed_down, variable, or unknown. Estimate the speed multiplier only when evidence supports it.
- Repeat the playback-rate classification for every segment. Cite observable cues such as motion cadence, gravity and settling, gait or blink cadence, camera shake, motion blur, audio pitch/cadence, duplicated or dropped frames, and discontinuities. Never infer speed from energy or editing style alone.
- Separate playback-rate changes from cuts, jump cuts, speed ramps, freeze frames, reverse motion, loop points, and ordinary fast subject movement. Mark uncertain classifications as unknown rather than forcing real time.
- Report segment lengths even when adjacent segments show the same subject or setting.

Also report narrative beats, subject/action/object state, framing and camera motion, lighting and setting, overlays and on-screen text, dialogue/music/sound, continuity dependencies, creative DNA, and identity/voice/logo/watermark/music/dialogue/bystander/minor transfer risks. Do not identify people. Conflicting or weak evidence must remain disputed and must not be silently promoted into reconstruction instructions.`;
